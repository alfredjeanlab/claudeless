  When claudeless runs in a TTY (like a tmux session), it ignores the positional prompt argument and enters interactive mode showing the welcome screen instead of processing
   the prompt. For example, claudeless --scenario test.toml "Hello" should process "Hello" immediately, but instead it displays "Try 'write a test for scenario.rs'" and     
  waits for manual input.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                             
  Expected behavior (matching real Claude): When a positional prompt is provided, process it immediately after startup, then remain in interactive mode waiting for follow-up
   input. Real Claude does this correctly - after accepting the trust prompt, it processes the positional argument and responds, then shows the input prompt for more        
  messages.
